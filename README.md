# Professional Portfolio with React <img src="ryansreactapp/src/assets/icons8-react.png">
## Summary

 Unit 20 React Homework: React Portfolio

This portfolio was built with the `JavaScript` open-source library `React` using UI Components and Navigation with `React Router`. The portfolio has a polished design with pure CSS styling, developed with the "mobile first" approach. `Navbar`, `Header`, and `Footer` components appear on multiple pages for greater accessibilty and ease of use when viewing main portfolio components: `Work`, `About`, `Resume`, and `Contact`.

Github Repository: [ReactPro_Portfolio](/)

Deployed to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

If you use React Router, you will **NOT** be able to use the `<BrowserRouter>` component on GitHub Pages. Read thand the [React Router documentation on HashRouter](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/HashRouter) for more information.


* **Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to GitHub and **NOT** your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by following the above instructions and using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's code.
